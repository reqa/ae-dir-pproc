Dear user,

a password reset for your user entry was requested.

If you did that yourself you should immediately set a new password by
entering the following link in your web browser. This is possible only
for a couple of minutes.

https://{web_ctx_host}{app_path_prefix}/resetpw?username={username}&temppassword1={temppassword1}

You will need a separate reset password.
This will be given to you by one of your zone admins:

{admin_email_addrs}

If you react too late to this e-mail and above link does not work you can
simply request the password reset again with this link:

https://{web_ctx_host}{app_path_prefix}/requestpw?username={username}

If someone else falsely invoked the password request you can simply
ignore this message or inform the administrator reachable through
{fromaddr}.

Your Ã† admins
