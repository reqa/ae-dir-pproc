Dear zone admin,

a password reset for a user entry was requested (see below).

Your actions if this request seems ok:

1. Please contact the user
   - personally or
   - via phone call to a known number

2. Tell the user his reset password you can read by accessing this link
   (needs your zone admin login):

   https://{web_ctx_host}/pwd/viewuser?othername={username}

If someone falsely invoked the password request you can simply
ignore this message.

Your Ã† admins
