Dear {user_cn},

the password of your Æ-DIR personal account was changed.

If you did that yourself everything is ok.

You can check whether it works:

https://{web_ctx_host}{app_path_prefix}/checkpw?username={username}

Security advice:
In case you did not know about this password change you should contact
the administrators immediately! They can investigate whether
someone else abused your account.

Your Æ admins
